# Zettelkasten (Atomic Notes)

### Atomic Notes are recognized as three parts;

1. **Smart notes are** Q.I.E.C (Questions, Ideas, Evidence, Conclusions) formatted.
2. **Smart notes are** atomic. The size and content of the notes matter and show me as specific as possible in concise and a descriptive format.
3. **Smart notes are** connected and can link together to form more atomic notes and larger structurely supported summaries.

### Break the text down into the Q.I.E.C Format:

**Questions:** underline the question.
**Ideas:** place a dot next to ideas.
**Evidence:** place a dash next to evidence.
**Conclusion:** place an asterisk next to conclusions.

Additional notes;
- What question is this evidence trying to answer?
- What other questions can the evidence be applied to?

### Reorganize to Compass Directional Format (CDF)

**Atomic Idea:** "X"
- **North:** Where does **X** come from?
- **South:** Where does **X** lead to?
- **East:** What is the opposite of **X**?
- **West:** What is similar to **X**?

## Example of Compass Directional Format

**Atomic Idea:** "You do not rise to your level of your **goals**, you fall to the level of your **systems**."
- **North:** "Goal-orientated thinking"
- **South:** "Remove bad 'habits' in organizations"
- **West:** "Systems thinking"
- **East:** "Goal-setting sets direction BEFORE systems"

# Frameworks

Break down the problem into a goal-orientated statement.
Example:
"profit = unit * cost". As units and/or costs go up, profit goes up. Nothing more, nothing less.
