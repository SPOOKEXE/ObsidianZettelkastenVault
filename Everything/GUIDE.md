# Zettelkasten (Atomic Notes)

### Atomic Notes are recognized as three parts;

1. **Smart notes are** Q.I.E.C (Questions, Ideas, Evidence, Conclusions) formatted.
2. **Smart notes are** atomic. The size and content of the notes matter and show me as specific as possible in concise and a descriptive format.
3. **Smart notes are** connected and can link together to form more atomic notes and larger structurely supported summaries.

### Break the text down into the Q.I.E.C Format:

**Questions:** underline the question.
**Ideas:** place a dot next to ideas.
**Evidence:** place a dash next to evidence.
**Conclusion:** place an asterisk next to conclusions.

Additional notes;
- What question is this evidence trying to answer?
- What other questions can the evidence be applied to?

### Reorganize to Compass Directional Format (CDF)

**Atomic Idea:** "X"
- **North:** Where does **X** come from?
- **South:** Where does **X** lead to?
- **East:** What is the opposite of **X**?
- **West:** What is similar to **X**?

## Example of Compass Directional Format

**Atomic Idea:** "You do not rise to your level of your **goals**, you fall to the level of your **systems**."
- **North:** "Goal-orientated thinking"
- **South:** "Remove bad 'habits' in organizations"
- **West:** "Systems thinking"
- **East:** "Goal-setting sets direction BEFORE systems"

# Frameworks

Break down the problem into a goal-orientated statement.

**Example:**
```
The framework "profit = unit * cost".

As units and/or costs increase, profit increase, and vise versa for decreasing.
Nothing more, nothing less.

This is simple framework describes what influences profit.
It would be either the fluctuation in units or the change in cost.

This lets you bring any driving point back to to this core "framework" of the problem that is being analyzed and allows a concrete flow of direction in said conversation and/or analysis.
