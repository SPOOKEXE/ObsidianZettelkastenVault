In the Japanese language, there are four character sets. They are named Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji and Romaji. Hiragana and Katakana are also known as the Japanese alphabet or "kana".

Katakana characters represent the same syllables as it's Hiragana counterpart, however, it is written differently and is used for foreign words.

These two writing scripts make up the Japanese alphabet.

Kanji characters represent a word or concept and unlike Hiragana and Katakana, there are thousands of Kanji plus there are also different leadings for each of them.
This makes Kanji characters harder to master, however, it is still important to learn them as well because they are essential in learning Japanese.
