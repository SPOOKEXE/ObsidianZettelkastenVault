|  か      | "KA" | question mark particle |
|      が | "GA" | dakuten variation |

The "dakuten" (takten) だくてん or "tenten" てんてん is placed on the upper-right corner of the character and makes the consonant of the syllable voiced; "KA" with dakuten is pronounced as "GA".
Voicing a consonant is done by creating a vibration in your vocal cords when you say it.

All characters in the K column can be affected by dakuten.
