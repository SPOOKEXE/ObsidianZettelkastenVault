The rest of the characters on the Hiragana Chart are consonant sounds excluding the ん character.

"い" is commonly seen in lots of writing as it is the suffix for adjectives.

"お" has a floating stroke and is also found in writing usually at the beginning of a verse to imply politeness.

"い" means 'stomach'.
"ラえ" means 'up, above'.
"あい" means 'love'.
"いいえ" means 'no'.
"あおい" means 'blue'.

Hiragana can be used to spell out Kanji by placing it ontop or by the side of the Kanji characters in small letters.

This use of Hiragana is called "Furigana".
